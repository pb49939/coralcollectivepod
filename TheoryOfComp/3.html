<h2>Example 3</h2>

<p>*Find a FA that accepts exactly those strings over {a, b} that end with abbaba. </p>

<p>If we use same idea from example 2, we have all states possible for this finite automoton = 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> = 127 states. This is too many states to draw out. </p>

<p>Instead, let's use only the potential prefixes of our target string and keep track of the longest suffix of the input read so far that is a prefix of the target string. </p>

<p>States needed: Lambda <em>empty string</em>, a, ab, abb, abba, abbab, abbaba </p>

<p><strong>Knuth - Morris - Pratt string search algorithm</strong><br/>
- Lambda x b -&gt; Lambda <em>since no accepting string can start with &quot;b&quot;, we have to start over at lambda</em><br/>
- a x a -&gt; a <em>starting from lambda, if we read a, then we move to a</em>
- ab x a -&gt; a <em>starting from lambda, move according to ba bc in the string, aba, the last &quot;a&quot; can stilll be useful to get to an accepting state</em>
- abb x b -&gt; lambda <em>starting from lambda, move according to bbb, which makes the next state return to lambda</em>
- abba x a -&gt; a
- abbab x b -&gt; abb *from lambda, move according to bbabb
- abbaba x a -&gt; a
- abbaba x b -&gt; ab</p>

<p><em>Lesson:</em> While we are constructing the machine, we can use what currently exists to build the rest of the machine* </p>

<p><strong>Definition of delta (star)</strong>
If we are in some state and we read nothing, stay put (state does not change) </p>

<p>If we are in state y and read symbol a, we move according to y and then make one more move according to the last symbol, a. </p>

<p>For every q in Q, y in Sigma*, a in Sigma </p>

<p><strong>Theorom:</strong> If certain languages can be accepted by a finite automoton, than other such languages can be accepted by a finite automoton. </p>

<p>If L1 and L2 are languages accepted by FAs M1 and M2 respectively, then there are FA that accept L1 Union L2, L1 Intersection L2, L1 minus L2, and L1 compliment (= Sigma * - L1). </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong><br/>
Assume that M1 = (Q1, Sigma, q1, A1 delta1) and M2 = (Q2, Sigma, q2, A2 delta2). The language accepted by M1 = L1 and the language accepted by M2 is L2. </p>

<p><em>L(M1) = L1 &amp;&amp; L(M2) = L2</em> </p>

<p><em>Idea is to keep track of the moves of both machines as we read the input. Use pairs of states to remember the state of each machine.</em> </p>

<p>Define M=(Q, Sigma, q0, A, delta) where<br/>
Q := Q1 x Q2 (cartesian product of the pair of the states from each machine)<br/>
q0 := (q1, q2) </p>

<p>delta((p1, p2), a) := (delta1(p1, a), delta(p2, a)) </p>

<p>For L1 Union L2, set A := {(p1, p2) in Q1 x Q2: p1 in A1 or p2 in A2} <strong>OR</strong> = (A1 x Q2) Union (Q1 x A2) </p>

<p><em>Accept if the first machine is in an accepting state or if the second machine is in an accepting state</em> </p>

<p>For L1 Intersection L2, set A := {(p1, p2) in Q1 x Q2: p1 in A1, p2 in A2} = A1 x A2 </p>

<p>For L1 - L2 set A := {(p1, p2) in Q1 x Q2: p1 in A1, p2 not in A2} = A1 x (Q2 - A2) </p>

<p>For L1 ' (Compliment of L1) use only M1 and set the set of accepting states to be Q1 - A1 <em>All of the states in Q1 that are not in the accepting states, A1</em> </p>

<p><strong>Suggested Exercises:</strong> {CH1: 52, 55, 60, 61, 68}, {CH2: 1, 4-9, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 33, 34, 40, 44, 54} </p>

<p><strong>Fininate Automoton</strong> a FA is a five tuple M such that M = (Q, Sigma, q0, A, delta) </p>

<ul>
<li>Q = finite set of states</li>
<li>Sigma = finite, non-empty alphabet</li>
<li>q0 = starting state</li>
<li>A = set of accepting states that is a subset of Q</li>
<li>delta = the transition function (<em>the moves</em>) Q x Sigma -&gt; Q</li>
</ul>

<p>Fix language L over some Alphabet Sigma (L is a subset of Sigma *)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> Two strings x,y in Sigma* are distinguishable with respect to L (Also called L-distinguishable) if there exists a string z in Sigma * such that <em>exactly</em> one of the two strings xz, yz is in L. </p>

<p>We say that such z <em>distinguishes x from y</em> </p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br/>
L = pal (the set of palendrones) over {a,b} </p>

<p>x = aba<br/>
y = bab </p>

<p><em>idea is we need to find a string such that if we appended it to both x and y, only one of x and y would be a palindrome</em> </p>

<p>chose z = ab -&gt; x = abaab (NOT PAL), y = babab (IS PAL)</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>
x = aba, <em>Is in PAL</em>
y = baa <em>Is not in PAL</em></p>

<p>chose z = lambda (the empty string) bc x is in PAL already, and y is not, so by appending the the empty string, they x and y are PAL-distinguishable </p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> </p>

<p>x = baa,
y = abb </p>

<p>we will choose z = a </p>

<p>xz = baaa (Not in PAL) and xy = abba (In PAL). This means that x and y are PAL distinguishable. </p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong> </p>

<p>x = baa,
y = baaa </p>

<p>chose z = b. xz = baab (IN PAL), xy = baaab (IN PAL). So now we know that z does not distinguish x from y with respect to PAL. </p>

<p>try again, lets chose z = babaab. xz = baababaab (IN PAL), xy = baaababaab (NOT IN PAL). So then we know that x and y are PAL distinguishable. </p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong> </p>

<p>L = {a, b}* ba <em>This is the language of strings a,b that end in ba</em></p>

<p>x = aba
y = abb </p>

<p>chose z = lambda (empty string) -&gt; xz = aba (Not IN L), yz = abb (IN L). So we know that x and y are L distinshiushable. </p>

<p>now take </p>

<p>x = aab,
y = bbb </p>

<p>If we chose z to be a, then both strings would be in the language. Essentially, both of these will be in L, or neither of them will be in L. We now need to show that no z will distinguish x from y. </p>

<p><strong>Proof by Cases</strong> </p>

<p>case 1: z = Lambda (empty string) -&gt; neither string is in L<br/>
case 2: z = a -&gt; both strings are in L<br/>
case 3: z = b -&gt; neither strings are in L<br/>
case 4: |z| &gt;= 2 -&gt; the last two symbols of z will be the same. This means that if the length of z is greater than or equal to 2, no matter what we chose z to be, either both xz and yz will be in L or neither xz or yz will be in L. </p>

<p>Since in none of the cases will z distinguish x from y with respect to language L, x and y are <strong>NOT</strong> L distinguishable. Or in other words, <em>x and y are L indistinguishable</em> </p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1</strong><br/>
Given a finite autamoton, M=(Q, Sigma, q0, A, delta), for all strings x,y and for every state q in Q, we have that </p>

<p><strong>1</strong> = delta*(q, xy) is the state that the machine ends up in if it starts at q and reads xy. </p>

<p><strong>2</strong> = delta(<em>(delta</em>(q, x), y) is the state that the machine ends up in if it first starts at state q and then reads x and then reads state y following. </p>

<p>1 and 2 are equal. </p>

<p><strong>This is going to be proved by induction</strong> </p>

<p>But now we have a new Lemma </p>

<p><strong>Lemma 2</strong> If M is a FA accepting language L and x, y are strings in Sigma* such that if delta<em>(q0, x) = delta</em>(q0, y), then x and y are L indistinguishable. </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> </p>

<p><em>Assumption a</em> Assume that d<em>(q0, x) = d</em>(q0, y). <em>We want to show that for every Z in Sigma star, xz, yz are both in L, or they both are not in L.</em></p>

<p>Pick any z in Sigma*. </p>

<p>d<em>(q0, xz) = (</em>By previous Lemma<em>)<br/>
= d</em>(d<em>(q0, x), z) = (</em>By our assumption a<em>)<br/>
= d</em>(d<em>(q0, y), z) = (</em>by previous Lemma<em>)<br/>
= d</em>(q0, yz)</p>

<p>So depending on whether d*(q0, xz) is in A or not, either both strings xz, yz will be in L neither will be in A. </p>

<p><strong>Take contrapositive of Lemma 2</strong> </p>

<p>If x, y are L distinguishable, then the states that we end up in must be different. </p>

<p>d<em>(q0, x) != d</em>(q0, y)</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 1</strong> </p>

<p>If M is a FA accepting L and x1, x2, ... , xn are pairwise L-distinguishable strings, then M must have at least n different states. </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>
d<em>(q0, x1), d</em>(q0, x2), .... , d*(q0, xn) must be all different bc any two of the strings x1, x2, ..., xn are L-indistinguishable. So |Q| &gt;= n. </p>

<p><strong>Corollary 2</strong> </p>

<p>If for a language L, there are infinitely many pairwise, L distinguishable strings, then no finite automaton can accept L. </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>
By contradiction, assume M is a FA accepting L. Let n = |Q|. By assumption, we can find n + 1 pairwise L distinguishable strings. So by Corollary 2, M must have at least n + 1 strings. But this is a contradiction, bc it only has n. </p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> </p>

<p>PAL = {x in {a, b}* : a is a palindrome} (x<sup>R</sup> = x). </p>

<p>PAL cannot be accepted by a finite automaton. </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> </p>

<p>We show that any two different strings xy in {a, b}* are PAL distinguishable. So by Corollary 2, no FA can accept PAL. </p>

<p>*<em>In order to accept PAL, you must remember the entire string that has been processed so far by the nature of deciding if a string is in PAL. This requires infinite states and storage. Thus not possible</em> </p>

<p>Given two fixed strings x, y in {a, b}* where x != y. </p>

<p><em>Idea is to first take the reverse of the first string and then add something to the middle of the first string after the first part and before the part that we just added that would make adding that string to each the first and second string, only one of them result in a PAL</em>. </p>

<p>Without loss of generality (WLOG), we may assume that x is not longer than y. (If x <em>is</em> longer, then just swap them). </p>

<ul>
<li>Case 1: |x| = |y| -&gt; chose z = the reverse of x. Then xz = xx<sup>r</sup> which is in PAL. But yz = yx<sup>r</sup> bc x != y.</li>
<li>Case 2: |x| &lt; |y| -&gt; chose z = cx<sup>r</sup> such that c is in {a, b}* and xc is not a prefix of y. <em>(chose c different from the corresponding symbol in y y=</em>***** + different form c)* Then xz = xcx<sup>r</sup> which is not in PAL bc xc is not a prefix of y.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>
If a finite automaton could have infinitely many states, show that it could accept any language. </p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>
Ln := {x in {a, b}* such that |x| &gt;= n and the nth symbol from the right in x is 'a'} </p>

<p>Given the above language, any FA accepting Ln must have at least 2<sup>n</sup> states. We must remember n strings from the end at all times. </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> We must show that any two different strings of length n are Ln distinguishable. </p>

<p>Pick x, y such that they both have length n where x != y. </p>

<p>Since x != y, they must differ in some symbol in the kth position for some k between 1 and n. </p>

<p>Say WLOG x has a in the kth position and y have b in the kth position. </p>

<p>We will choose z to be any string such that in &quot;xz, yz&quot; this will be the nth position from the right. This will be any string of length (k - 1). </p>

<p><strong>Pumping Lemma</strong> </p>

<p>idea -&gt; we are given a FA M with n states, accepting language L. Consider a string, x in Sigma star such that |x| &gt;= n. </p>

<p>x = x1x2x3...xm where m&gt;=n </p>

<p>As M reads x, it goes through some states. During the computation of the FA, M goes through n + 1 states. But it only has n states. So at least one state must have been repeated. In math writing, this means that </p>

<p>d<em>(q0, y1y2y3y4y5) = qn <strong>AND</strong>
d</em>(q0, y1y5) = qn <strong>AND</strong>
d*(q0, y1y2y2y2y2y2y2y5) = qn</p>

<p>If qn is an accepting state, then ew know that we have multiple strings that will be in the accepting state. </p>

<p><strong>Theorem and actual Pumping Lemma</strong>
<em>If there is a string that is longer than the number of states, then that string can be broken into the three parts, and the middle part can pumped any number of times and the resulting string will still be in the language</em> </p>

<p>Let L be a language accepted by a FA M with n states. If x is in L such that t |x| &gt;= n, then we can write x in the form
1. x = uvw <em>for some strings u, v, w</em>
2. |uv| &lt;= n, |v| &gt;= 1
3. (u)(v<sup>k</sup>)(w) is in the language L. (For k=0,1,2,3.....) <em>You can PUMP v as many times as you want and the resulting string will still be in the language L</em> </p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>
As M reads x, it will read its symbols. Since |x| &gt;= n, during this it will go through at least n + 1 states. So at least one state q must repeat. (Let q be the first repeated state). Let u be the portion of x until M gets to q and let v be the portion of x until M gets to q the second time, and let w be the rest of x: </p>

<p><strong>q0</strong> ---u---&gt; <strong>q</strong> -----w---&gt; <strong>A</strong> (Accepting State).
There is also so v that links <strong>q</strong> back to itself. </p>

<p>Since q in the first repeated state, |uv| &lt;= n and clearly |v| &gt;= 1 and uv<sup>kw</sup> is in L for every k in real numbers. </p>

<p>PL (Pumping Lemma) can be used to show that certain languages can't be accepted by any finite automaton by showing that no v exists such that breaking the strings into three parts u, v, w can be &quot;pumped&quot; n times resulting in the resulting string still being in the language. <em>If you show that the pumping lemma does not hold for a certain language, then you can show that the language is not a finite automaton.</em> </p>
